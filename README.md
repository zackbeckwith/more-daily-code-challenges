# Code Challenges 2.0

## Intro

More code challenges!!!

## Instructions

- All challenges have one or more tests that run when the `run-tests-by-opening-in-browser.html` file is opened in the browser. 

- By default, Jasmine (the testing framework) will run the tests in random order. To prevent this, click on the Options button near the top-right of the page and uncheck the run tests in random order checkbox.

- Solve the challenges by writing functions in the `challenges.js` file only.

- Each code challenge requires writing a **single function** to solve.

- Be sure to name the function **exactly** as specified by the challenge.

- The default display shows only the challenges that are failing. To see an overall summary of all tests, click the "**Spec List**" link.

- After we finish the exercises as a class, the solution(s) will be posted in `solutions.js`.
